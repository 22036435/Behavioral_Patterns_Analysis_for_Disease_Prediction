# Behavioral Patterns Analysis for Disease Prediction in Psychology

## Introduction

This project, conceived by Ayse Asli Ilhan as part of the Advanced Algorithms and Complexity Final Project, aims to pioneer in the field of mental health by developing a predictive system that bridges the gap between behavioral signals and psychological ramifications. Utilizing computational analysis, sophisticated algorithms, and deep psychological insights, this initiative seeks to identify early behavioral patterns indicative of potential mental health illnesses, thus enabling timely and focused therapeutic interventions.

## Objectives

To design a predictive system combining data analytics, advanced algorithms, and psychological insights to identify early indicators of potential mental health issues.

To contribute to the advancement of customized healthcare by providing medical practitioners with actionable insights for preventative planning and interventions.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

### Data Sources

Patient behavior logs, survey responses, physiological data, and social media data for natural language processing (NLP).

Emphasis on ethical standards and patient confidentiality during data collection.

### Preprocessing Steps

Utilization of Pandas DataFrames for data loading and initial processing.

Handling of missing values and feature engineering for both categorical and numerical variables.

Application of tokenization and sentiment analysis on social media data for NLP.

## Algorithm Selection and Implementation

Divide and Conquer for Data Segmentation: Employed to sort and segment data by education levels for focused analysis.

Greedy Algorithms: Kruskal's algorithm for creating a meaningful pattern of behavior network from a dense correlation matrix.

Randomized Algorithms: Utilized for simulating patient data to test the predictive models' stability and accuracy.

Advanced Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques: Implementation of a Stacking Classifier combining multiple models for enhanced predictive accuracy.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development

Developed using Python's Tkinter toolkit, the GUI facilitates easy input of data and visual feedback, enhancing user interaction and engagement.

## Model Evaluation and Validation

Incorporated various strategies for robust model testing, including accuracy, precision, recall, and cross-validation to ensure the model's predictive reliability.

## Ethical Considerations

Adhered to HIPAA regulations and ethical standards in psychological research, ensuring the integrity and privacy of patient data.

## Conclusion and Future Work

The project underscores the potential of integrating data science with psychology for early detection of mental health issues. Future enhancements may include expansion of data sources, computational resources, and exploration of additional machine learning algorithms for improved accuracy.

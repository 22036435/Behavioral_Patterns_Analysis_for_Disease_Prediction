Behavioral Patterns Analysis for Disease Prediction in Psychology

    I. Introduction

        A. Problem Statement
            Focus: Examine specific mental health disorders through behavioural patterns.
            Significance: Utilizing behavioural analysis for predicting mental health disorders provides essential insights for early intervention.
        B. Project Objective
            Goal: Develop an advanced predictive system to analyze behavioural patterns and predict mental health disorders.

    II. Data Collection and Preprocessing

        A. Data Collection
            Sources: Gather data from patient behaviour, survey responses, and physiological data, ensuring adherence to data privacy and ethical guidelines.
        B. Data Preprocessing
            Loading Dataset:
                Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame for initial data handling.
            Handling Missing Values:
                Address missing values by applying appropriate strategies like filling with the mean or forward fill, depending on the dataset context.
            Feature Engineering:
                One-Hot Encoding: Transform categorical variables such as 'Education', 'Device Type', etc., into a machine-learning-friendly format. This encoding process converts categorical data into binary vectors.
                Scaling: Standardize numerical features like 'Age', 'Tiredness', etc., to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step is crucial for algorithms sensitive to the scale of input features.
            Combining Transformations:
                Utilize a ColumnTransformer to apply these preprocessing steps in a structured pipeline, ensuring efficient and organized data transformation.
            Conversion to DataFrame:
                Post-transformation, convert the processed data back into a data frame. This step enhances readability and facilitates further data analysis and modelling.

    III. Algorithm Selection and Implementation

        A. Divide and Conquer Algorithms: Data Organization
            Functionality: Implement a divide-and-conquer strategy by segmenting the dataset based on 'Education' levels.
            Process:
                Extract unique education levels and create sorted subsets.
                Sort each subset based on 'Anxiety' levels in ascending order.
                Store these sorted subsets for further analysis.
            Example Output: Display a sorted subset for a specific education level, e.g., 'Completed Masters'.
        
        B. Greedy Algorithms: Network Creation using Kruskal's Algorithm
            Application: Kruskal's algorithm, a greedy algorithm, was employed to create a network for identifying significant behavioural patterns.
            Implementation Details:
                The algorithm was used to analyze the correlation matrix derived from the dataset, identifying strong correlations between different behavioural features.
                A minimum spanning tree was constructed using Kruskal's algorithm. This tree represents the most significant connections (highest correlations) between different behavioural indicators.
                This network helps visualize and understand the intricate relationships between various behavioural factors and their collective impact on mental health.
        
        C. Randomized Algorithms: Simulation
            Method: Utilize random selections to generate simulated patient data.
            Implementation:
                Create simulated patient profiles using random values from the dataset's distributions.
                Generate multiple simulated patients for scenario analysis.
        
        D. Advanced Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques
            Data Preprocessing:
                Apply one-hot encoding for categorical variables like 'Education', 'Region', 'Gender', etc.
                Scale numerical features (excluding 'Age', now a categorical variable) to standardize data.
                Use ColumnTransformer to combine these transformations in a pipeline.
                Impute missing values using strategies such as mean imputation.
            Model Building and Validation:
                Split the transformed and imputed data into training and testing sets.
                Define base classifiers including RandomForest, LogisticRegression, and SVC.
                Implement a StackingClassifier with a meta-classifier (Logistic Regression) for enhanced predictive accuracy.
                Train and evaluate the stacking classifier, reporting its accuracy.
                Additionally, train and evaluate a standalone Logistic Regression model, examining the coefficients for feature importance.
            Statistical Analysis:
                Perform OLS regression using stats models to derive detailed statistical insights.
            Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
                Conduct PCA on standardized features, excluding certain variables like 'Household Income'.
                Analyze eigenvalues to understand the variance explained by the principal components.
            BERT Classification for Text Analysis:
                Implement a BERT-based text classification model to analyze textual data.
                Train the model on labelled data, evaluating its performance on a validation set.
                Apply the model to predict sentiments in test sentences, showcasing its NLP capabilities.

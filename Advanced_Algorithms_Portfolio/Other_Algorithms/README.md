#Problem Statement: Kargerâ€™s Minimum Cut Algorithm

    #Background

        In graph theory, a cut is a partition of the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets. The minimum cut problem seeks to find the smallest cut (in terms of the number of edges) that divides the graph into two such subsets. This problem has implications in various fields, including network design, community detection in social networks, and more.

    #Problem Description

        Given a connected, undirected, and unweighted graph, the objective is to find the smallest list of edges whose removal would split the graph into two disconnected subsets. The goal is to identify this list of edges such that no smaller set of edges exists, which, when removed, would also disconnect the graph.

    #Algorithm
       
       Karger's algorithm is a randomized algorithm to solve this problem. The algorithm proceeds as follows:

        Select a Random Edge: Choose an edge uniformly at random from the graph.
        Merge Nodes: Remove the selected edge and merge the two nodes it connects into a single node. This merging effectively combines the two nodes and their adjacent edges.
        Remove Self-loops: After merging nodes, remove any resulting self-loops (edges that connect a node to itself) to avoid cycles in the graph.
        Repeat: Repeat steps 1-3 until only two nodes remain in the graph. The set of removed edges constitutes the minimum cut.

#FIFO and LRU Caching Algorithms in Python

    #Overview

        This Python script is designed to simulate and compare two fundamental caching algorithms: First-In, First-Out (FIFO) and Least Recently Used (LRU). It generates a sequence of random integers and processes them through both caching strategies, allowing for an analysis of their behavior and efficiency.

    #Features

        Random Integer Generation: Generates a sequence of 1000 random integers ranging from 0 to 9.
        FIFO Implementation: Implements the First-In, First-Out caching algorithm.
        LRU Implementation: Implements the Least Recently Used caching algorithm.
        Customizable Cache Size: Users can specify the cache size for both FIFO and LRU algorithms.
        Cache State Tracking: Tracks and records the state of the cache at each step for both algorithms.
    
    #How to Use

        Setting Up: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
        Running the Script: Execute the script in a Python environment. Upon running, the script will prompt you to enter the desired cache size.
        Viewing Results: After execution, the script will provide the cache states throughout the processing of the 1000 inputs for both FIFO and LRU algorithms.
    
    #Implementation Details

        The script uses Python's standard libraries and does not require external dependencies.
        The fifo_cache function simulates the FIFO caching strategy, while the lru_cache function simulates the LRU strategy.
        Random integers are generated using Python's random module.
        The cache state at each step is stored in a list, which can be printed or analyzed after the script's execution.

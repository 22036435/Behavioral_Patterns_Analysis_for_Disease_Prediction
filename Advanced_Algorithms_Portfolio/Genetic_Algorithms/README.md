#Traveling Salesman Problem Solver using Genetic Algorithm

    #Overview

        This project presents a solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a Genetic Algorithm. The TSP is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem that seeks the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city. Our solution applies a genetic algorithm, which is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection, to find an efficient route among a given set of cities with known distances between them.

    #Features

        Matrix Representation of Graph: The distances between cities are represented as a symmetric matrix, providing an intuitive and efficient way to store and access the data.
        Genetic Algorithm Implementation: Utilizes genetic operators like selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve solutions towards the best path.
        Customizable Parameters: Allows adjustment of parameters like population size, mutation rate, and number of generations for flexibility and performance tuning.

    #Algorithm Explanation

        The genetic algorithm iteratively evolves a population of candidate solutions towards an optimal solution. It starts with a randomly generated initial population. Each individual in the population represents a possible solution (path) and is evaluated based on its total distance. The algorithm then repeatedly applies genetic operators to this population:

        Selection: Selects the fittest individuals for reproduction.
        Crossover: Combines pairs of individuals to produce offspring.
        Mutation: Introduces random variations to produce new features.
        The process repeats for a given number of generations, or until a satisfactory solution is found.

    #Limitations

        The algorithm does not guarantee the most optimal solution, as genetic algorithms are heuristic methods.
        Performance depends on the parameter settings and the complexity of the input.
